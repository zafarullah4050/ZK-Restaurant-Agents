# 🚀 Built an AI-Powered Restaurant Assistant with Multi-Agent Tools (Order, Reservation, Delivery, Upsell)

I'm excited to share my new project — a fully functional **AI Restaurant Assistant** built using **Python, LangChain, Streamlit, and Groq LLM (Llama 3.1)**.
This agent behaves like a real restaurant staff member and can:

🍽 **Show Menu**
🛒 **Take Orders** (stores orders in real-time)
📅 **Reserve Tables**
🚚 **Check Delivery Availability**
🔥 **Give Smart Upsell Suggestions**
⚠️ **Register Complaints**
🧠 **Auto-detect intent using an AI agent**
📊 **Display Latest Orders & Reservations in a live admin dashboard**

### 🔧 Tech Stack

* **Python (FastAPI + Streamlit UI)**
* **LangChain** for agent and tool orchestration
* **Groq Llama 3.1** for ultra-fast responses
* **Custom Tools:** menu, order, reserve, delivery, upsell, complaint
* **Real-time state updates (order_state & reservation_state)**
* **In-memory datastore + future DB support**

### 🎯 Key Features

✔ AI auto-detects user intent (order, reserve, complaints)
✔ Order/Reservation stored instantly and shown in dashboard
✔ Roman Urdu support for friendly user conversation
✔ Clean UI with chat history + admin panel

### 💡 Why I built this

To understand how **multi-agent architectures** work in real apps, and how LLMs can interact with tool functions in Python to perform real operations — not just chat.
